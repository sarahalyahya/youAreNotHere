Many were taken to prison camps. I've heard that during the winter, the tide gets so high that the waves hit the side of the house.

My cousins and I spent days trying to tie a rope on the thickest tree branch we could find.
The day we finally did, we swung and swam into the river until that branch broke -- dethroning us as kings of the jungle.

I want you to know I went to a waterfall in North Palestine, but it was in an occupied town. I only knew the Hebrew name, and nobody knew the Arabic one, the real one. There was a mattress thrown away in the waterfall, and there was trash everywhere, it blocked a dam that generated power. I would like to tell you more, I feel like my generation of memory is very public at the moment.

Speak soon,
